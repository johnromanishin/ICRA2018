These robots, capable of operating either individually or in a group, also possess the structural modular morphology that enables them to adapt to the unstructured nature of a real environment. Over the past two decades, significant work has been published in this field, particularly in the aspects of autonomy, mobility and docking. This paper reviews the primary methods in the literature related to the fields of modular and reconfigurable mobile robotics. By bringing together aspects of modularity, 
	including docking and autonomy, and synthesizing the most relevant findings, there is optimism that a more complete understanding of this field will serve as a starting ground for innovation and integration of such technology in the urban environment.}}

	abstract="Soldercubes are a self-reconfiguring modular robot (MR) system whose modules are light weight, low cost, and designed with manufacturability for large batch production in mind. The frequently cited promises of modular robotics---versatility, robustness, and low cost---assume the availability of large numbers of modules. However, modules in most MR prototypes are large, mechanically complex, expensive, and difficult to manufacture. Soldercubes partially overcome this contradiction through optimizing some components for volume manufacturing processes. With the integration of a soldering connector which weighs only 2Â g and has no moving parts, Soldercubes are among the cheapest, lightest and smallest among comparable self-reconfiguring MR systems. This paper describes the Soldercube module design in detail, reports on experiments in a lattice configuration, explores non-lattice applications of the system, and discusses the effects of utilising volume manufacturing processes in module production. All Soldercubes design files are released as open source hardware.",
