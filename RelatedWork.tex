Modular self-reconfigurable robots are often characterized by their
system topology: lattice, chain, or hybrid~\cite{Yim-RAM07}.  Most of
the systems currently under development including U-Bots~\cite{ubot},
Roombots~\cite{roombots3}, and SMORES~\cite{Yim-RAM07} utilize a hybrid
architecture. The fundamental distinction between hybrid or chain modules and
strict lattice systems is that hybrid or chain modules have either fewer
connector faces than lattice faces, or these connector faces are
located in off-lattice positions.  Chain and hybrid
systems are typically designed to self-reconfigure using complicated
implementations which approximate simpler models, such as the sliding cube model~\cite{FitchRus-IROS03} or
the pivoting cube model~\cite{RomanishinRus-IROS13}.

There are several different types of passive tagging technologies designed allow the recognization of tags. These include RFID, NFC, QR-Codes, April Tags, etc...
