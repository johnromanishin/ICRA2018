While the exact performance of the \tagName system will be implementation dependant i.e. different size/shape magnets, encoder ICs, etc... we performed two categories of experimentation to demonstrate that our implementation of the \tagName concept is feasible and useful in the context of modular robots. The first section~\ref{sec:characterize} attempts to characterize the \tagNamePlural in terms of repeatability and accuracy of multiple measurements under varying conditions and to investigate the behavior when tags are misaligned. The second section~\ref{sec:mblocksExperiments} illustrates the use of the \tagNamePlural implemented on a system consisting of 8 active 3D M-Blocks modular robots, in addition to numerous passively tagged modules.
