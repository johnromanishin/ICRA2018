\section{Experiments}
\label{sec:Experiments}

These experiments were implemented on a set of 12 Modified 3D M-Block modules. The control system which is running the experiments is described in Figure~\ref{fig:electroncsChart}.

\caption{This figure illustrates the various avenues of information exchange between the different elements of the experimental setup. The \emph{orange} arrows represent bi-directional WIFI messages sent between the immobile \emph{Server Module} and the active modules, with the dashed line showing a potentially faulty connection. The \emph{blue} arrows show the simple light-based messages which active modules are able to send to neighbors that they are directly connected to. The \emph{purple} arrows represent the reading of \tagNamePlural~ between an active module and a valid and adjacently connected \tagName. Note that \tagNamePlural can be read from both passive modules, and from passive or even unresponsive modules.}

\subsection{Arrow Following experiments}
\label{sec:mblocksExperimentsArrow}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
We performed two set of experiments involving, the first involving only reading passive non-unique "arrow" tags, and the second including the
"virtual" or "stigmergic" arrows utilizing the globally unique connector faces embedded in active modules.

These experiments involved several attempts to convert arbitrary generated 3D structures with a few constraints (no holes, and no modules connected by three or more connection faces) into a single horizontal line involving between 8 and 12 modules.

These experiments essentially attempt to implement the photo-taxis Braitenberg behavior for a group of M-Blocks modules. There is a single light source, and a special target module, which when modules aggregate to it, the modules share its location through wireless and light signals for additional modules to connect to it - essentially forming a single "crystal" of aggregated modules. In these experiment modules are gradually released into a confined (0.5m x 0.5 m) bounded foam-padded location, and move until they either run out of battery or connect to the designated aggregate.
